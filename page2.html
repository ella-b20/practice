<h2 style="text-align:center">ABOUT US</h2>
<h1 style="text-align:center">Mogutable curates beautiful items for you to enjoy in your home and everyday life.</h2>
<p>We are Yingchi and Yuchen, the people behind Mogutable. Originally from Taiwan, we are a Brooklyn-based sister duo.</p>
<p>Our shop features a selection of unique, well-designed, aesthetically-pleasing objects, sourced from our favorite artisans, locally and internationally.</p>
<p>We hope Mogutable becomes a space to inspireâ€”a community for artists, designers, and fans to come together and create something new.</p>
